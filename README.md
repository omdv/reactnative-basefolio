#  cryptofolio

Free cryptocurrency portfolio tracker for Coinbase/GDAX users. Automated polling of transactions and prices. Convenient dashboard. Calculation of P/L for all positions.

Basefolio is a free cryptocurrency portfolio tracker which I wrote for my own use. If you are one of 13+ million of Coinbase/GDAX users and are tired of manually entering all transactions this app is for you. Feature-rich dashboard modelled after a great stock-trading app by Robinhood. Backend calculations to give you a complete view of your P/L both for open and closed positions.
