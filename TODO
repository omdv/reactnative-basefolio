TODO:

features:
- (DONE) prices re-download
- (DONE) logout
- add functionality to add positions
- returns over different periods
- add totals to positions screen

- request historical prices only for dates when orders are active - depends on whether I'll allow to add transactions manually later?
REMOVE - Add positions acquired before coinbase, i.e. when coins are send to Coinbase
- acitivity indicators
- different failures when requesting API
- disable refresh button when fetching
- when refreshing prices it launches an infinite loop
- if initial prices fail but accounts go through - the activity indicator keeps going

PRIOR TO RELEASE:
- Clean AccountsRedux and Sagas - redundant
- Remove if (hist_prices) in Financial Functions

General:
- Define features and screens clearly and start working on MVP
